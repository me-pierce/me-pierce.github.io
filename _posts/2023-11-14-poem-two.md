I was quite broken  
and told you that it would be to much  
you told yourself 'how bad can it be?'  
and decided to stay  
without intention you were cruel  
and with great courage I tried to let you know  
your ego could not listen  
and isolation was added to my pain  
now that I am less broken  
I am surprised to find  
that you took no great care  
and I am not impressed
